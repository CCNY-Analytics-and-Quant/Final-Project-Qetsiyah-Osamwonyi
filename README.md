# Final Project
## Brief Overview
### Primary Objective 
Use Berry Cox’s price momentum factors to select basket of assets for a long-short portfolio. Backtest your algorithm for 5 years to check for performance of algorithm.
### Background 
The use of computers and coding allows finance professionals to identify new alpha factors – Alpha factors are ways of quantifying where alpha is being generated by an asset. You will be responsible for using Berry Cox’s list of alpha factors to determine the long/short baskets for your portfolio. But in order to test your code and its asset selections, back-testing must be performed.
